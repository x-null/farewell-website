                            James' Reasons for departure on xNULL Discord
                            <svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true"> <use xlink:href="#ext-link"></use> </svg>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A short version for people that can’t access our Discord server is that James steps away and parts
                    ways with the community, <strong>mainly for personal reasons</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    James owns the xNULL name and domain and he wants to keep them for his other projects or businesses
                    he might start in the future. xNULL was always meant to be a general programming forum, not a gaming
                    focused one, but James offered it to the MoH community. It became its new home after TMT forum was
                    closed down and we are grateful for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years it grew into a community for most MoH players, server owners, modders and alike. It
                    used to be a place where everyone was welcome to share their mods and tools, show off cool maps and
                    ask for help or troubleshoot issues. It was also a place where development of the Reborn patch took
                    place and it became a center of gravity on the forum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of fond memories and for some of us it was a place where we made new friends or found
                    interest and passion for programming.
                    It has been <strong><span class="text-nowrap">15 years</span> of ongoing support</strong>
                    and one of the longest (if not THE longest) running MoH community website on the Internet in history,
                    which is a huge achievement, not only for MoH, but for many other community driven projects in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of that, and we would like to thank you all for going along with us for such a
                    long and fruitful ride!<br/>

                                    Masterserver is a system that makes the online server list work, game servers and
                                    game clients need to connect to it.

                                    After the GameSpy shutdown, the in-game server browser stopped working and we had to
                                    switch to using an alternative masterserver developed by xNULL in-house. Since we
                                    don’t own gamespy.com domain, this means that MoH binaries and the Reborn patch
                                    distributed over the years point to the <strong>master.x-null.net</strong> domain.

                                    Last year we switched the domain to point to masterserver services provided by

                <p>
                    Over the years xNULL was a home for Reborn patch development. Given that xNULL will soon no longer
                    exist in its current form, I&nbsp;would like to continue working on MoH and the Reborn patch in my
                    free time. I enjoy tinkering, building stuff for myself and sharing it with others. It’s a nice
                    escape from a day to day job and it brings me joy to use my skills in a fun way for the benefit of
                    others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will continue to develop the patch and build tools for the game at my own pace, on my own terms
                    with a full creative control and I’m excited about what the future might bring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are still interested in MoH modding, you play the game or host a server and would still like
                    to keep in touch with like-minded people after xNULL shuts down, I’d like to invite you to a new
                    place dedicated to the unofficial patch and MoH modding. The place is newbie friendly so you can
                    visit and ask the most basic questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you plan on using the Reborn patch on your server or want to have carefree gaming experience in
                    the future, make sure you follow its development to be up to date with new releases. Don’t forget to
                    update or install the patch before we hit <span class="text-nowrap">2027-03-01</span>

                    This is a new place where legacy MoH websites are hosted.
                    You can go there to access the old xNULL forum and AAAA website.

                <p>
                    In the future the place might host other old MoH related content for history preservation purposes.
